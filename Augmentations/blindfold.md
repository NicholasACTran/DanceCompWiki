# Blindfold

Other names:
- Jedi

## Summary

This augmentation of a competition is generally straightforward in concept: have the competitors be blindfolded as they dance. For a smooth execution, preparation is important.

## Setup

The following questions need to be answered:
- How many blindfolds are needed? (minimum: enough for each competitor in a heat)
    - If there's not enough blindfolds to give one to all competitors, how are the blindfolds being distributed and collected?
- What is the space set-up for the competition?
- Who are the volunteers aiding the blindfolded dancers?

## Structure

### Setup
1. Prepare all the blindfolds and distribute them to the competitors
2. Prepare the volunteers to assist in herding the competitors
3. Prepare the space so it's easy to herd the competitors

### Changes to the normal format
1. Competitors should generally be blindfolded before they see who they are dancing with (in Mix and Match prelims)
    1. If need be, the volunteers can herd the competitors into line
2. In Mix and Match Formats, multiple volunteers will need to be in charge in guiding competitors in rotation
3. Volunteers will lead blindfolded competitors onto the dance floor
4. Volunteers will act as buffer in-between dancers
5. Volunteers will lead competitors back into line
6. If blindfolds need to be collected in between heats, it should be done immediately and as quickly as possible

### Additional Extensions

#### Separate Starting Positions

In the finals, the couples can start disconnected and have to find each other on the floor. To make it more diverse, a rule can be made to avoid the competitors from using words.
