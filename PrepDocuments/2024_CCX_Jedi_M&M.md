Sign up for the Jedi Mix and Match! Prelims will happen at Cats Corner Saturday at 12pm. Participants will be blindfolded and dance 3-4 songs with a random partner! Judges will deliberate and choose finalists from the prelim competitors! 

Finals will happen that night during the third band break. Finalists will be blindfolded and matched randomly with one partner.

Pendant cette danse, les couples commenceront à se séparer et devront se retrouver sans utiliser de mots ! Les finalistes auront ensuite droit à un dernier tour de piste avant d'être jugés par le public.
