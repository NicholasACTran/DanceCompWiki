- M&M
- Social Dance Competition

## Summary

The Mix and Match is a partnered format, where competitors are matched up randomly in prelims with a variety of partners. It is in general, the most popular format of the Lindy Hop/Swing Dance world as it attempts to encapsulate the goal of capturing the magic of social dance in a competition. Prelims can take on a couple different formats, with different pros and cons to each.

## Setup

### Judging

It is typical to have about 3-7 judges (usually odd numbers) per role (lead/follow). In each role, or overall, there can be a "head" judge for the purposes of tie-breakers. In the Standard format, Relative Placement Judging is usually used. In Elimination Format, Tap-Out Judging is usually used.

### Pre-Competition Randomization

Oftentimes, dancers who know each other will sign up for the competition at the same time or check-in to the event at the same time. This can create a scenario where dancers can potentially game the system, purposefully or accidentally, and be put in the same heat as each other. This can be prevented by giving a random number to the competitors on sign-in or registration, and then ordering the competitors numerically.

### Dividing the Heats (Non-Elimination Formats)

When dividing the heats for the prelims format, 3 concerns need to be taken into account:

- Fairness for the competitors/judges
- Efficiency for the event/audience
- Imbalance of roles

With a large number of dancers, we would ideally want the minimum number of dancers per heat in order to allow for the judges to accurately judge each competitor. However, this is a competing concern with keeping the prelims of the competitions short for the sake of time. Lastly, when handling an imbalance of roles, oftentimes, the role with less entrants will have some dancers dance in more than one heat. This can be a boon or a curse to the competitors.

The strongest compromise would be to aim to have small-ish heats (6-10 couples per heat), where each heat has approximately the same number of couples, and simply run the heats **very quickly**. This means to have very little downtime between heats, little to no MC-comping, and very quick rotations and resets between dances. This can lead to an estimation of approximately 5-6 minutes per heat if executed correctly.

### Handling Imbalance of Roles

Often times in Standard Format for M&M, the imbalance of roles is handled by calling back the competitors from the first heat to fill-in in latter heats. This is generally accompanied with an addendum that judges are not *supposed* to judge these repeat competitors. While it is a nice sentiment, judges are human and can be influenced by what they see in a repeat heat. Furthermore, there can be some minor unfairness with competitors who get matched with repeat competitors. This can include the repeat competitors being tired from dancing, or more warmed up from dancing. Thus, the competitors in the first heat can end up having a separate opportunity situation than competitors in future heats.

While the previous method of handling the imbalance is alright, another potential method would be to randomize which competitors repeat in a future heat. This gives an equal chance across all the competitors to repeat. While not perfect, as this can exacerbate the situations of some dancers being more tired from dancing, this can represent a compromise.

Note: It is important to allow dancers who don't want to dance again to opt out of this repeat scenario.

### Decisions to be Made Ahead of Time

- Which role is rotating?
- What direction is the rotation happening?
- Who is handling guiding competitors through the rotation?
- How the number of rotations is being chosen?
- Which direction are competitors entering and exiting the stage?
- How is the room organized for competitors and audience?

## Variations

### Standard

1. Competitors are called out and lined up for judges to quickly verify numbers
2. MC chooses and announces the number of rotations for the rotating role. The rotating role is guided in rotation
    1. This step can be skipped for the first partnership if it is pre-randomized
3. Competitors take a place on the dance floor and dance for the allotted time
4. Competitors return to the line in the order that there were just in
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for each dance in the rest of the heat
6. Competitors exit 
7. Repeat steps 1-6 for future heats
    1. If there is an imbalance of roles, call up repeat competitors for the imbalanced heat (prepping them ahead of time)

Pros:
- Expected and straightforward to understand
- Truly random

Cons:
- Truly random
- Competitors can have a high chance of negative experience if they are matched with incompatible dancers
- In high imbalance of roles, there can be vastly different expereinces for different competitors

### Split Imbalance

In this format, the imbalanced role is actually split between the heats.

Special Setup:
- Take the difference of the imbalance between roles and divide it between the number of heats. That is the number of additional dancers of the more popular role in each heat
    - An example: There are 20 follows and 16 leads. There will be 2 heats. Thus, (20 - 16) / 2 = 2 -> There will be 2 additional follows per heat. There will be 10 follows and 8 leads per heat.
- Since some subset of the more popular role will be sitting out for 1 song per heat, it's important to have one additional song per heat to even out the balance (e.g. If there are more follows, then we want to aim to have each follow dance 3 or 4 songs in a heat, instead of 2 or 3 songs). DJs should prep accordingly.

    1. This step can be skipped for the first partnership if it is pre-randomized
3. Competitors take a place on the dance floor and dance for the allotted time
4. Competitors return to the line in the order that there were just in
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for each dance in the rest of the heat
6. Competitors exit 
7. Repeat steps 1-6 for remaining heats

Pros:
- Handles the imbalance of roles in a relatively fair way, where every competitor will get approximately the same experience
- Truly random

Cons:
- Truly random
- Competitors can have a high chance of negative experience if they are matched with incompatible dancers

### Elimination Format

In this format, the tap-out judging style is used to reduce the number of competitors over the course of a singular heat.

Special Setup:
- Take note of the imbalance between roles

1. Competitors are called out and lined up for judges to quickly verify numbers
2. MC chooses and announces the number of rotations for the rotating role. This number is the number of additional dancers of the more popular role in that heat.
3. Competitors take a place on the dance floor and dance for the allotted time
4. Competitors return to the line in the order that there were just in
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for 2 additional dances.
6. Judges will now tap-out the dancers until the roles are even and the numbers of competitors are reduced.
7. Repeat Steps 2-4 + 6 For each additional dance in the heat, until the final number of finalists is found.
6. Competitors exit 

Pros:
- Handles the imbalance of roles in a relatively fair way, where every competitor will get approximately the same experience
- Competitor experience will improve as the heat is reduced
- Creates a scenario where the judges have to make active decisions on each dancer
- Single heat competition
- Very fast

Cons:
- Requires more space
- Slightly less random as time competitors get tapped out
    - This is under the assumption that dancers' skill level will generally increase in-between songs
