## Summary

This repo represents a wiki on how to run different dance competitions. By default, this takes the approach from a swing dance (Lindy Hop) and jazz dance perspective. This repo is divided into 3 main sub-directories:
- Formats

- Augmentation

In Formats, it will detail the variety of formats (prelims and finals) that can be executed. In Scoring, it will detail the variety of potential scoring methodologies. Lastly, in Augmentations, it will detail potential ways to augment or extend different formats for variety or interest.
